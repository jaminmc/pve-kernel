Subject: [PATCH] Fix AppArmor double-free issue with simpler approach

This patch fixes the AppArmor double-free issue in aa_free_profile() by
using a simpler and more reliable approach than the complex logic in the
recent ubuntu-kernel commits.

The issue occurs when profile->disconnected_ipc points to the same memory
as profile->disconnected, causing a double free. Instead of the complex
pointer comparison logic that was introduced, this patch uses a simple
approach: set disconnected_ipc to NULL when it points to the same memory
as disconnected, then only free disconnected_ipc if it's not NULL.

This approach is more reliable and avoids the complex logic that may be
causing issues with Proxmox containers and LXC environments.
